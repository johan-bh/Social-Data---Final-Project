    "Crime is a major concern in many cities around the world. Society is always looking for ways to reduce crime rates and make cities safer. If we don't feel safe walking around our city, we can't enjoy the city's amenities or be as happy and productive as we could be. Therefore, our goal with this project is firstly to identify which crimes are the most important for travelers and residents in a city. As New york is one of the largest and most visited cities in the world, we chose to analyze the crime data of this city, as it has abundant and free data available, as well as a large number of crimes reported. Another goal is to identify when and where these crimes occur most frequently so that we can provide a tool to help people make informed decisions about their safety while travelling or working and living in New York City. Finally, the last goal is to examine how socio-economic factors and other variables can influence or help explain crimes rates in the city. This will ultimately help people stay safe and make better decisions about where to live, work, and travel in New York City.\n",

    "- What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our chosen dataset is the New York City Police Department (NYPD) Complaint Data Historic [dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/qgea-i56i?category=Public-Safety&view_name=NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic) which can be found on the [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) website. The dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to 23rd april 2024. We have downloaded it on 23 April 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this dataset was chosen is because it is the largest and most comprehensive dataset available for crimes in New York City. We therefore felt it would be most representative of the true crime rates, and would give us room to narrow our datastory into something more specific, and still have enough data to accurately convey our message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the user to be able to get a glimpse into which crimes are important to look out for, and give them a tool in which they are explore the data further with socio-economic overlays, as well as plot a route which avoids crime hotspots. "

Given our proposed user segment we believe this tool really compliments that narrative and could be a useful tool both for educational and practical purposes. We spent a lot of time on the visualization of Use Case 1 to accomplish the following features which we deem important:\n",
